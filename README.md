An official implement of 《Find Gold in Sand: Fine-Grained Similarity Mining for Domain-Adaptive Crowd Counting》
The code will be released after the paper is received.
# OverView
Our work proposes a domain-adaptive framework for crowd counting based on more sufficient and reliable inter-domain similarity. The framework not only effectively utilizes multi-scale domain alignment to explore inter-domain similarity fully but also filters these distributions using evidence theory based on various similarity measures.
